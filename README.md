# NumPy-to-work-with-numerical-data

Pandas, which is built on top of NumPy. Think of Pandas as a high-level data manipulation tool that includes functionality for working with time series or for grouping, joining, merging and finding missing data (i.e., everything we've been doing so far). NumPy on the other hand shines with low-level tasks, like doing serious math and calculations.

## you'll learn:

- How to leverage the power of NumPy's ndarrays.

- How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array.

- How broadcasting works with ndarrays.

- How to do linear algebra with NumPy.

- How to generate points that you can plot on a chart.

- How to manipulate images as ndarrays.


## Learning:

- Create arrays manually with np.array()

- Generate arrays using  .arange(), .random(), and .linspace()

- Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray

- Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices

- Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication

- Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible

- Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays
